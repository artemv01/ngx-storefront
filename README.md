# An eCommerce application built on Angular & NestJS & TailwindCSS (the Customer UI part)

Ngx-storefront is an example of a modern eCommerce application built on TypeScript stack. The project consists of 3 parts:

*   the Customer UI [artemv01/ngx-storefront][ngx-storefront]
*   the REST API [artemv01/ngx-storefront-api][ngx-storefront-api]
*   and the Admin UI (coming soon)

This is a repository for the customer UI. 

## Technology stack

![Stack image][stack]

The technology stack used for the customer UI consists of:
* [Angular][angular]
* [NgRx][ngrx]
* [TailwindCSS][tailwind]
* [SCSS][scss]

Deployed on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

## Live demo

## Whatâ€™s currently missing

The project is on its initial stage and there are still some important features that are yet to be implemented. Such as:

*   Stripe integration
*   Customer dashboard
*   Product variations
*   Custom product attributes
*   Coupon system
*   Some others

Unit tests are work in progress.
